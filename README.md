## Hi there, I'm skypjack 👋

[![zak](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1812216/101640887-5e9ba800-3a31-11eb-8b2f-861f2920301e.gif)](https://github.com/skypjack)

Despite what you may have thought, I'm not Zak. I’m **Michele Caini**, software developer from **Florence, Italy**.<br/>
I'm also a **freelancer**, I work mainly remotely and in my free time I dedicate myself to some open source projects such as [`EnTT`](https://github.com/skypjack/entt).<br/>
Oh... and I'm a father too, madly in love with my wife and son who always support me! :heart_eyes:

### 🔭 I’m currently working on ...

**Minecraft**, in collaboration with the Microsoft Mojang Studios :astonished: and I'm very grateful to them for this opportunity.<br/>
I like the game and I like the team behind it as well. I'm struggling to do my best, time will tell me if I have succeeded.

### 📫 How to reach me ...

Check the links in my profile, you should find everything you need, from my blog to my mail and social networks.<br/>
Since I **love** connecting with new people, feel free to ping me to say _hello_, introduce yourself and have a chat.

### 💻 I'm a freelancer ...

I already said it? Forgive me then :slightly_smiling_face: and don't hesitate to contact me if you want to offer a collaboration.<br/>
I'm passionate about C++ and I'm particularly interested in gaming, high performance and optimization topics.

### 🙏 Support me if you like ...

Everything you can find on my GitHub profile or on my blog I do in my spare time, without any kind of income.<br/>
If you want to help me by contributing or otherwise supporting me, you can take a look at my [sponsorship page](https://github.com/sponsors/skypjack).
