### Hi there, I'm skypjack ðŸ‘‹

[![zak](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1812216/101640887-5e9ba800-3a31-11eb-8b2f-861f2920301e.gif)](https://github.com/skypjack)

Despite what you may have thought, I'm not Zak. Iâ€™m **Michele Caini**, software developer from **Florence, Italy**.<br/>
I'm also a **freelancer**, I work mainly remotely and in my free time I dedicate myself to some open source projects such as [`EnTT`](https://github.com/skypjack/entt).<br/>
Oh... and I'm a father! I owe much of my happiness to my wife and son. They are the _task_ I spend the most time on with no regrets! :smile: :heart_eyes:

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...

**Minecraft**, in collaboration with the Microsoft Mojang Studios and I'm very grateful to them for this opportunity.<br/>
I like the game and I like the team behind it as well. I'm struggling to do my best, time will tell me if I have succeeded.
