### Hi there, I'm skypjack 👋

[![zak](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1812216/101640887-5e9ba800-3a31-11eb-8b2f-861f2920301e.gif)](https://github.com/skypjack)

Despite what you may have thought, I'm not Zak. I’m **Michele Caini**, software developer from **Florence, Italy**.<br/>
I'm also a **freelancer**, I work mainly remotely and in my free time I dedicate myself to some open source projects such as [`EnTT`](https://github.com/skypjack/entt).<br/>
Oh... and I'm a father too, madly in love with my wife and son who always support me! :heart_eyes:

Something about me:

* 🔭 I’m currently working on **Minecraft**, thanks to the Microsoft Mojang Studios :astonished: and I'm very grateful for this opportunity.
* 💻 I'm a freelancer. Don't hesitate to contact me if you want to offer a collaboration. Fond of C++, gaming and high perf.
* 📫 Check the links in my profile. Feel free to ping me to say _hello_, introduce yourself and have a chat. 🙂
